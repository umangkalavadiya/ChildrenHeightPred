Our solution provides digital measurement for children for below age less than 5 years to detect and reduce malnutrition.
The provided dataset contains a csv file and depthmap images of childrens. The rows in csv file contains the entry for children and their corresponding pose prediction and height in cm and depthmap file id. The raw depthmap files are also provided in the depthmap folder.
Total 9 records of children have been provided for code development purpose.


Problem statement:
Given the dataset of depthmap images and corresponsing pose key points and height of the children, Design the solution and write the code which can be used to train a model and predict the height of the children. You are free to choose approach be it a Machine learning, Deep Learning or any other approaches along with having the reason of selecting for the same. 

Note: The candidate need not to worry about the training and accuracy of the model as we have provided sample dataset. The approach and working code is enough for the further evaluation.
